<summary>PR Checklist</summary>
<br/>

__Please leave this checklist in your PR.__

- Source changes maintain stated browser compatibility.
- Includes updated docs demo bundle if source/docs code was changed (run `yarn demo-bundle` in your branch and include the `/docs/demo-bundle.js` file that gets generated in your PR).
- Issue being fixed is referenced.
- Unit test coverage added/updated.
- E2E (i.e. demos) test coverage added/updated.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-covered demos (look for `IS_CYPRESS_ENV === ''` [here](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap/blob/master/docs/js/index.js), as well as `in-open-shadow-dom.js` that can't be fully tested in Cypress) __manually__ verified.
- Typings added/updated.
- README updated (API changes, instructions, etc.).
- Changes to dependencies explained.
- Changeset added (run `yarn changeset` locally to add one, and follow the prompts).
  - EXCEPTION: A Changeset is not required if the change does not affect any of the source files that produce the package bundle. For example, tooling changes, test updates, or a new dev-only dependency to run tests more efficiently should not have a Changeset since it will not affect package consumers.
